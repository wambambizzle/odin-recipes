  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>

    <!-- <p>This Buffalo chicken dip starts with two cans of chunk chicken, making it extra easy and affordable. Of course, you can substitute rotisserie chicken or shredded chicken breasts if you'd prefer.</p> -->
    <p>2 (10 ounce) cans chunk chicken, drained</p>
    <li><strong>Cream Cheese</strong></li>
    <!-- <p>Make sure the cream cheese is softened for easy incorporation.</p> -->

    <li><strong>Hot Sauce</strong></li>
    <!-- <p>Hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's) turns up the heat, mimicking the spicy flavor of Buffalo chicken wings. Use more or less than the recipe calls for to suit your flavor preferences.</p> -->
    <p>¾ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot)</p>
    <li><strong>Cheese</strong></li>
